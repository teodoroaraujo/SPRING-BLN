Your task is to write a script or app, which gathers data from two endpoints asynchronously, merges the responses and displays them in any way, for example as JSON response from an REST API.

For example you could use these two endpoints:

*http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 to obtain a user's data
*http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1 to obtain all comments written by that user
